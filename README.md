# Bio-molecular Simulation
# Main page
This is the compilation results of my simulation for completing the "hello world" tutorial using biomolecular modelling software. The link source of the tutorials that are provided.<br/>
Do not to forget check the Readme in each section for more information and link to the source.

# Setup (on Windows 10)
- WSL2 
WSL is Windows sub-Linux which we can use a Linux subsystem in the Windows operating system so we can use Linux specific only biomolecular software. for more information on how to install WSL2 on windows go to this link: https://erikbreslmayr.medium.com/gromacs-on-windows10-ac38fa5653e
- GUI on WSL2 
up until this text was written the official GUI for WSL2 was not provided by Microsoft. Therefore using another third-party system to connect it via Remote Desktop Connection. This is the link source that I follow the instruction for providing GUI on my WSL2 system : https://davidbombal.com/wsl2-ubuntu-gui/
