# Setup (on Windows 10)
- WSL2 
WSL is Windows sub Linux which we can use Linux sub system in the Windows operating system so we can use linux specific only biomolecular sofware. 
for more information of how to install WSL2 on windows go to this link: https://erikbreslmayr.medium.com/gromacs-on-windows10-ac38fa5653e

- GUI on WSL2
up until this text is written the official GUI for WSL2 was not provided by microsoft. Therefore using other third-party system to connect it via Remote Desktop Connection.
